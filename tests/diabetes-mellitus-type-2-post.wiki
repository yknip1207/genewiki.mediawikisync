'''Diabetes mellitus type 2'''{{ndash}}formerly '''non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)''' or '''adult-onset diabetes'''{{ndash}}is a [[metabolic disorder]] that is characterized by high [[blood glucose]] in the context of [[insulin resistance]] and relative [[insulin]] deficiency.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Abbas, Abul K.; Cotran, Ramzi S. ; Robbins, Stanley L. | authorlink= | title=Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease | year=2005 | edition=7th| publisher=Saunders | location=Philadelphia, Pa. | isbn=0-7216-0187-1 | pages=1194–1195}}</ref> [[Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes]] is often initially managed by increasing [[physical exercise|exercise]] and [[dieting|dietary modification]]. If the condition progresses, medications may be needed. Often affecting the [[obesity|obese]], diabetes requires patients to routinely check their [[blood sugar]].

Unlike [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]], there is very little tendency toward [[Diabetic ketoacidosis|ketoacidosis]] although it is not unheard of.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fasanmade|first=OA|coauthors=Odeniyi, IA, Ogbera, AO|title=Diabetic ketoacidosis: diagnosis and management.|journal=African journal of medicine and medical sciences|date=2008 Jun|volume=37|issue=2|pages=99–105|pmid=18939392}}</ref> One effect that can occur is [[Non Ketonic Hyperglycemic coma|nonketonic hyperglycemia]]. Long-term complications from high blood sugar can include increased risk of [[heart attack]]s, [[strokes]], [[amputation]], diabetic retinopathy where eye sight is affected, and [[kidney failure]].  For extreme cases, circulation of limbs is affected, potentially requiring amputation.  Loss of hearing, eyesight, and cognitive ability has also been linked to this condition.

==Signs and symptoms==
The classic symptoms of diabetes are [[polyuria]] (frequent urination), [[polydipsia]] (increased thirst), [[polyphagia]] (increased hunger), fatigue and weight loss.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cooke DW, Plotnick L |title=Type 1 diabetes mellitus in pediatrics |journal=Pediatr Rev |volume=29 |issue=11 |pages=374–84; quiz 385 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18977856 |doi=10.1542/pir.29-11-374 |url=}}</ref> Type II diabetes has been associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia through disease processes such as Alzheimer's disease and [[Multi-infarct dementia|vascular dementia]].

Nutr., Mar 2010; 140: 437 - 445.</ref> A clue for this concept was the [[Dutch_hunger_winter|Dutch Hunger Winter]] and the pioneering work of Professor Barker.

===Lifestyle===
A number of lifestyle factors are known to be important to the development of type&nbsp;2 diabetes. In one study, those who had high levels of physical activity, a [[healthy diet]], did not smoke, and consumed alcohol in moderation had an 82% lower rate of diabetes. When a [[Classification of obesity|normal weight]] was included, the rate was 89% lower. In this study, a healthy diet was defined as one high in fiber, with a high polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio, and a lower mean [[glycemic index]].<ref name="Mozaffarian D, Kamineni A, Carnethon M, Djoussé L, Mukamal KJ, Siscovick D 2009 798–807">{{cite journal |author=Mozaffarian D, Kamineni A, Carnethon M, Djoussé L, Mukamal KJ, Siscovic, D |title=Lifestyle risk factors and new-onset diabetes mellitus in older adults: the cardiovascular health study |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=169 |issue=8 |pages=798–807 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19398692 |doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2009.21 |pmc=2828342}}</ref> [[Obesity]] has been found to contribute to approximately 55% of cases of type&nbsp;2 diabetes,<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults with diagnosed diabetes—United States, 1988–1994 and 1999–2002 |journal=MMWR.

Environmental toxins may contribute to recent increases in the rate of type&nbsp;2 diabetes. A weak positive correlation has been found between the concentration in the urine of [[bisphenol A]], a constituent of some plastics, and the incidence of type&nbsp;2 diabetes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lang IA, Galloway TS, Scarlett A, ''et al.'' |title=Association of urinary bisphenol A concentration with medical disorders and laboratory abnormalities in adults |journal=JAMA |volume=300 |issue=11 |pages=1303–10 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18799442 |doi=10.1001/jama.300.11.1303}}</ref>

===Medical conditions===
There are many factors which can potentially give rise to, or exacerbate, type 2 diabetes. These include obesity, [[hypertension]], elevated [[cholesterol]] ([[combined hyperlipidemia]]), and with the condition often termed [[metabolic syndrome]] (it is also known as Syndrome X, Reavan's syndrome, or CHAOS). Other causes include [[acromegaly]], [[Cushing's syndrome]], [[thyrotoxicosis]], [[pheochromocytoma]], chronic [[pancreatitis]], cancer, and drugs. Additional factors found to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes include aging,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jack L, Boseman L, Vinicor F |title=Aging Americans and diabetes.

===Genetics===
There is also a strong inheritable [[genetics|genetic]] connection in type 2 diabetes: having relatives (especially first degree) with type 2 increases risks of developing type 2 diabetes substantially. In addition, there is also a mutation to the Islet Amyloid Polypeptide gene that results in an earlier onset, more severe, form of diabetes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sakagashira S, Sanke T, Hanabusa T, ''et al.'' |title=Missense mutation of amylin gene (S20G) in Japanese NIDDM patients |journal=Diabetes |volume=45 |issue=9 |pages=1279–81 |year=1996 |month=September |pmid=8772735 |doi=10.2337/diabetes.45.9.1279|accessdate=19 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Cho YM, Kim M, Park KS, Kim SY, Lee HK |title=S20G mutation of the amylin gene is associated with a lower body mass index in Korean type 2 diabetic patients |journal=Diabetes Res.

About 55 percent of type 2 diabetes patients are [[obesity|obese]] at diagnosis<ref>{{cite journal |last=Eberhart|first=M. S.|coauthors=Ogden, C, Engelgau, M, Cadwell, B, Hedley, A. A., Saydah, S. H., |title=Prevalence of Overweight and Obesity Among Adults with Diagnosed Diabetes --- United States, 1988--1994 and 1999--2002|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
|volume=53 |issue=45 |pages=1066–8 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15549021 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5345a2.htm |accessdate=19 July 2008}}</ref> —chronic obesity leads to increased insulin resistance that can develop into type 2 diabetes, most likely because [[adipose tissue]] (especially that in the abdomen around internal organs) is a source of several chemical signals, hormones and [[cytokines]], to other tissues.  Inflammatory cytokines for example may activate the [[NF-κB]] pathway which has been linked to the development of insulin resistance.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shoelson SE, Lee J, Goldfine AB |title=Inflammation and insulin resistance |journal=J Clin Invest. |volume=116 |issue=7 |pages=1793–801 |year=2006 |month=Jul |pmid=16823477 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16823477 |accessdate=15 July 2011 |doi=10.1172/JCI29069 |pmc=1483173}}</ref>

Other research shows that type 2 diabetes causes obesity as an effect of the changes in metabolism and other deranged cell behavior attendant on insulin resistance.<ref name=IntJObes.1999-Camastra>{{cite journal |author=Camastra S, Bonora E, Del Prato S, Rett K, Weck M, Ferrannini E |title=Effect of obesity and insulin resistance on resting and glucose-induced thermogenesis in man. EGIR (European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance) |journal=Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=1307–13 |year=1999 |month=December |pmid=10643689 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0801072|accessdate=19 July 2008}}</ref>

However, environmental factors (almost certainly diet and weight) play a large part in the development of type 2 diabetes in addition to any genetic component. This can be seen from the adoption of the type 2 diabetes epidemiological pattern in those who have moved to a different environment as compared to the same genetic pool who have not. Immigrants to Western developed countries, for instance, as compared to lower incidence countries of origins.<ref>Cotran, Kumar, Collins; '''Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease,''' Saunders Sixth Edition, 1999; 913-926.</ref> Such developments can also be found in environments which have had a recent increase in social wealth, increasingly common throughout Asia.

There is a stronger inheritance pattern for type&nbsp;2 diabetes. Those with first-degree relatives with type&nbsp;2 diabetes have a much higher risk of developing type&nbsp;2 diabetes, increasing with the number of those relatives. [[Concordance (genetics)|Concordance]] among [[Twin#Monozygotic twins|monozygotic twins]] is close to 100%, and about 25% of those with the disease have a family history of diabetes. Genes significantly associated with developing type&nbsp;2 diabetes, include ''[[TCF7L2]]'', ''[[PPARG]]'', ''[[FTO gene|FTO]]'', ''[[KCNJ11]]'', ''[[NOTCH2]]'', ''[[WFS1]]'', ''[[CDKAL1]]'', ''[[IGF2BP2]]'', ''[[SLC30A8]]'', ''[[JAZF1]]'', and ''[[HHEX]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lyssenko V, Jonsson A, Almgren P, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical risk factors, DNA variants, and the development of type 2 diabetes |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=359 |issue=21 |pages=2220–32 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=19020324 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0801869}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

Gene expression promoted by a diet of fat and glucose, as well as high levels of inflammation related cytokines found in the obese, results in cells that "produce fewer and smaller mitochondria than is normal," and are thus prone to insulin resistance.<ref>{{cite news|first=|last=|coauthors=|title=The origin of diabetes Don't blame your genes They may simply be getting bad instructions—from you|publisher=Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14350157|date=3 September 2009}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Insulin resistance means that body [[cell (biology)|cells]] do not respond appropriately when insulin is present.<ref>Umapathy,C. (2011). The state and future of closed loop insulin pumps/artificial pancreas. http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi/Umapathy%20Chandravadhana.pdf?case1301604304 </ref>

This is a more complex problem than type 1, but is sometimes easier to treat, especially in the early years when insulin is often still being produced internally. Severe complications can result from improperly managed type 2 diabetes, including [[renal failure]], [[erectile dysfunction]], blindness, slow healing wounds (including surgical incisions), and [[artery|arterial]] disease, including [[coronary artery disease]]. The onset of type 2 diabetes has been most common in [[middle age]] and [[old age|later life]], although it is being more frequently seen in adolescents and young adults due to an increase in child obesity and inactivity. A type of diabetes called [[MODY]] is increasingly seen in adolescents, but this is classified as a diabetes due to a specific cause and not as type 2 diabetes.

In the 2008 Banting Lecture of the American Diabetes Association, DeFronzo enumerates eight main pathophysiological factors in the type 2 diabetic organism <ref>DIABETES april 2009, 58: 773-795</ref>

Diabetes mellitus with a known etiology, such as secondary to other diseases, known [[genetic disorder|gene defects]], trauma or surgery, or the effects of drugs, is more appropriately called secondary diabetes mellitus or diabetes due to a specific cause. Examples include diabetes mellitus such as MODY or those caused by [[hemochromatosis]], pancreatic insufficiencies, or certain types of medications (e.g., long-term [[steroid]] use).

Recent studies of pancreatic beta cells have indicated a molecular connection between diet, obesity that involves the role of fat in activating a pathway to type 2 diabetes.<ref>Ohtsubo, K., Chen, M.Z., Olefsky, J.M., and Marth, J.D. (2011) "Pathway to diet– and obesity–associated diabetes through attenuation of pancreatic beta cell glycosylation and glucose transport." Nature Medicine, in press.</ref> In this mechanism, loss of beta cell glucose sensing contributes substantially to the early manifestation of diabetes, and beta cell dysfunction is responsible for the onset and severity of multiple systemic disease signs including impaired glucose tolerance, hyperglycemia, hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in muscle and adipose cells.  Previous work published in past decades by the laboratories of Roger Unger, Jerrold Olefsky, and Bernard Thorens alluded to the possibility of the importance of beta cell function and glucose sensing in these disease signs.  This mechanism of beta cell dysfunction may be contributing substantially to the current epidemic of type 2 diabetes.

===Medications===
{{Main|Anti-diabetic medications}}
[[Image:Metformin 500mg Tablets.jpg|thumb|Metformin 500mg tablets]]

There are several classes of medications available. [[Metformin]] is generally recommended as a first line treatment as there is good evidence that it decreases mortality.<ref name=AFP09/> Injections of [[insulin]] may either be added to oral medication or used alone.<ref name=AFP09/> Other classes of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes are [[sulfonylureas]], [[nonsulfonylurea secretagogues]], [[alpha glucosidase inhibitors]], and [[thiazolidinediones]].<ref name=AFP09/>

====Insulin====
When [[insulin]] is used, a long-acting formulation is usually added initially, while continuing oral medications.<ref name=AFP09/> Doses of insulin are increased to effect.<ref name=AFP09/>

===Surgery===
[[Gastric Bypass]] procedures are currently considered an [[elective surgery|elective procedure]] with no universally accepted algorithm to decide who should have the surgery. In the diabetic patient, certain types result in 99-100% prevention of insulin resistance and 80-90% clinical resolution or remission of type 2 diabetes. In 1991, the [[NIH]] (National Institutes of Health) Consensus Development Conference on Gastrointestinal Surgery for Obesity proposed that the [[body mass index]] (BMI) threshold to consider surgery should drop from 40 to 35 in the appropriate patient. More recently, the [[American Society for Bariatric Surgery]] (ASBS) and the ASBS Foundation suggested that the BMI threshold be lowered to 30 in the presence of severe co-morbidities.<ref name=pmid18212321>{{cite journal |author=Cummings DE, Flum DR |title=Gastrointestinal surgery as a treatment for diabetes |journal=JAMA |volume=299 |issue=3 |pages=341–3 |year=2008 |pmid=18212321 |doi=10.1001/jama.299.3.341 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18212321}}</ref> Debate has flourished about the role of gastric bypass surgery in type 2 diabetics since the publication of The Swedish Obese Subjects Study. The largest prospective series showed a large decrease in the occurrence of type 2 diabetes in the post-gastric bypass patient at both 2 years ([[odds ratio]] was 0.14) and at 10 years (odds ratio was 0.25).<ref name=pmid17509385>{{cite journal |author=Folli F, Pontiroli AE, Schwesinger WH |title=Metabolic aspects of bariatric surgery |journal=Med.

A study of 20-years of Greenville (US) gastric bypass patients found that 80% of those with type 2 diabetes before surgery no longer required insulin or oral agents to maintain normal glucose levels. Weight loss occurred rapidly in many people in the study who had had the surgery. The 20% who did not respond to bypass surgery were, typically, those who were older and had had diabetes for over 20 years.<ref>{{cite journal

===Progression===
The way type 2 diabetes is managed may change with age. Insulin production decreases because of age-related impairment of pancreatic beta cells. Additionally, insulin resistance increases because of the loss of lean tissue and the accumulation of fat, particularly intra-abdominal fat, and the decreased tissue sensitivity to insulin. Glucose tolerance progressively declines with age, leading to a high prevalence of type&nbsp;2 diabetes and postchallenge hyperglycemia in the older population.<ref name="health">{{cite journal |author=Harris MI, Flegal KM, Cowie CC, ''et al.'' |title=Prevalence of diabetes, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance in U.S. adults.

==Prognosis==
{{Main|Complications of diabetes mellitus}}
Even if properly and carefully managed, type 2 diabetes is currently a chronic disease, which is, in most cases, compatible with an otherwise full life. Some cases, for reasons obscure, cannot be reasonably managed and lead to damage or even death sooner than later. Non-compliance with management is a contributor in some cases (unwillingness to monitor blood glucose, take prescribed medication, or reliance on unusual or exotic treatment regimes without credible track record), but not all. Much of the damage is due to the complications of diabetes, not directly to diabetes' acute effects. For example, in the developed world, and increasingly elsewhere, type 2 diabetes is the largest cause of non-traumatic blindness and kidney failure.<ref name=AFP09/>

Research continues and several potential treatments may result in "cures". Examples include resection surgery of the upper small intestine, and very stringent restricted calorie diets. None is, as of 2011, sufficiently well understood, or adequately tested, to be of clinical significance. One or more might, possibly, become clinically significant for some cases, or even all, but this is some years away in the most fortunate instance.
