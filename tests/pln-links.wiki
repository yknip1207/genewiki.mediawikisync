== Function ==

The protein encoded by this gene is found as a pentamer and is a major substrate for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase ({{SWL|target=protein kinase A|label=PKA|type=substrate_for}}) in cardiac muscle. The protein is an inhibitor of cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>++</sup>-ATPase ({{SWL|target=SERCA|type=negatively_regulates_gene_product}}) in the unphosphorylated state, but inhibition is relieved upon [[phosphorylation]] of the protein. The subsequent activation of the Ca<sup>++</sup> pump leads to shorter intervals between contractions, thereby contributing to the [[lusitropic]] response elicited in heart by [[beta2-adrenergic agonist|beta-agonist]]s. The  protein is a key regulator of  {{SWL|target=diastole|label=cardiac diastolic function|type=regulates_biological_process}}. Mutations in this gene are a cause of inherited human [[dilated cardiomyopathy]] with refractory [[congestive heart failure]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: PLN phospholamban| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=5350| accessdate = }}</ref>

When phospholamban is [[phosphorylated]] by {{SWL|target=protein kinase A|label=PKA|type=phosphorylated_by}} its ability to inhibit the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) is lost.<ref name="isbn0-8089-2333-1">{{cite book | author = | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Medical Physiology | edition = | language = | publisher = Saunders | location = Philadelphia | year = 2004 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-8089-2333-1 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Thus, activators of PKA, such as the beta-adrenergic agonist [[epinephrine]] (released by [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] stimulation), may enhance the rate of cardiac myocyte relaxation. In addition, since SERCA is more active, the next [[action potential]] will cause an increased release of calcium, resulting in increased contraction (positive [[inotropic]] effect). When phospholamban is not phosphorylated, such as when PKA is inactive, it can interact with and inhibit SERCA. The overall effect of phospholamban is to decrease the rate of {{SWL|target=muscle relaxation|type=negatively_regulates_biological_process}} and {{SWL|target=contractility|type=negatively_regulates_biological_process}}, thereby decreasing heart rate and stroke volume, respectively.<ref name="pmid11112989">{{cite journal | author = Brittsan AG, Kranias EG | title = Phospholamban and cardiac contractile function | journal = J.
